# Interactive-Tattoos (Smarttoo)
Tattoos, which can act as remote controls directly from the skin, explore unused real estate space in the field of wearables. Smarttoo enables interaction with the skin on an epithelial level and boasts of larger possibilities regarding input modality. Smarttoo recognises input using capacitive touch signals and accordingly gives feedback- either a visual or aural, depending on the model. We can design new interfaces that enable wearers to play games and music and control devices from their skin or clothing. Welcome to the future of on-skin electronics. We present to you, Smarttoo.
The repository includes the `.ino` file which can be used to create a musical capacitive sensor which can be placed on the skin and be further be modified to include various features. 

## Problem Statement
While all age groups commonly apply tattoos, they are becoming increasingly ordinary and lifeless. Tattoos have been explored in depth as a form of art but not as an interactive medium.

## Target Buyers
As people wear them to express their independence, mostly the Millennials(people in the age group 18-35 years) wear tattoos as a means to adorn their bodies. Also, tattoo artists buy these beautiful wearables so that they can experiment on them and draw them on people.

## Components
* The Tattoo: Using Gold, silver, copper or graphite capacitive sensors
* Capacitive Sensors made from scratch 
* Resistors (10K ohm)
* Arduino Nano
* RGB LED Strip
* Piezo-buzzers for sound production

## Libraries required
* CapacitiveSensor.h
